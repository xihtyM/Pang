Obscured by the computer, Skyler gives Walt a vigorous
handjob with one hand and works the mouse with the other.
SKYLER
Just relax. Just ••• close your
eyes and let it •••
Skyler glances again at her husband. Apparently, theres no
mighty oak sprung from whence the lowly acorn lies.
SKYLER
Just close your eyes.
walt does so, concentrating. Trying hard. Tugging away,
Skylers attention drifts back to the computer. Completely.
SKYLER
Thats it. Thats ••• it.
There you go. Keep going. Keep
going. Keep it going. Keep •••
(reacting to the screen)
Yes! Fifty-six.
Walts eyes open. The thrill is gone.
EXT. CALTECH CAMPUS - DAY
Old Pasadena. Wide greenbelts and dark magnolias. The sign
says Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Einstein was a visiting
professor at Caltech, once upon a time. This place looks it.
INT. JPL - DAY
MARS fills frame, stark red rocks and red sand. We PAN OFF
this blow-up of Martian terrain -- were in a hallway mounted
with two dozen such photos, big and striking.
Small in the distance stands Walt. Hes not looking at any
of these photos. Hes down an adjacent hallway, staring at
something else, instead.
CLOSER ANGLE - WALT
Hes studying names engraved on an old plaque. Its a list
of grad students awarded a particular research grant.
Closer. ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 1988 -- Walter H. White.
Walt stares at his own name on the plaque. We cant read his
thoughts, but we can guess at them.
17.
EXT. CALTECH CAMPUS - COFFEE STAND - DAY
An outdoor snack bar. Walt sits alone. Around him, young
STUDENTS pore over textbooks or quietly type on laptops.
Walt sips his coffee and stares into space.
At the nearest table, a CHINESE GUY sits with two CHINESE
GIRLS. Theyre laughing and talking in CANTONESE. They keep
their voices low so their gossip might not be overheard --
but its not like we have any idea what theyre saying.
Walt takes another sip of coffee, carefully sets down the
cup. He looks at his hand for a long moment.
He notices his fingers are TREMBLING slightly. He makes a
fist, squeezes it tight. Opens it.
The Asian students are talking a mile-a-minute, the two girls
giggling. walt glances at them, looks back to his hand. He
presses it flat against the tabletop.
UP-ANGLE -- as seen through this GLASS TOP TABLE, Walts
fingers stick to the surface. They pull loose with a slow,
gluey SLURP.
CLOSER on Walt. He rubs his mouth, sneaks his fingertips to
his carotid artery just under his ear. Hes feeling his
pulse. The furtive whispering in CHINESE fills his head.
Hes starting to breathe faster.
His cellphone RINGS. He glances at the readout screen.
HOME, it says. Walt silences it, tucks the phone back in
his pocket.
Rapid-fire CHINESE is all we hear. Now it gets drowned out
by a sudden WHOOSH that makes Walt blink. Its the whoosh of
the nearby cappuccino machine. Its unnaturally loud, like a
jet engine. Walts had enough. Time to go.
HIGH ANGLE - DOWN THROUGH THE TREES
Magnolia leaves sway in f.g. Were looking down at Walt,
tiny in the distance, as he rises to his feet. He makes it
three steps before he COLLAPSES, flipping an empty table.
Students look up, hesitate. The Chinese guy and a couple of
others rise to help. Off Walt, lying on his face •.•
